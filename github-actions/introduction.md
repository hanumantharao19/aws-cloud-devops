## What is GitHub Actions?
- GitHub Actions is a native CI/CD and automation platform provided by GitHub that allows you to automate software workflows directly from a GitHub repository.
- It enables teams to build, test, and deploy code based on repository events such as commits, pull requests, and manual triggers.

## Why GitHub Actions?

- GitHub Actions eliminates the need for external CI/CD tools by providing tight integration with GitHub repositories.

## Key benefits:

- Native integration with GitHub repositories and pull requests
- Event-driven automation (push, PR, schedule, manual)
- Supports Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) deployments
- Marketplace with reusable community and official actions
- Scales from simple CI to enterprise-grade CD pipelines


## Common Use Cases
- CI pipelines for build, test, and code quality checks
- CD pipelines for deploying applications and infrastructure
- Terraform automation for AWS, GCP, and multi-cloud environments
- Security scanning and compliance checks
- Scheduled automation tasks (cron jobs)
