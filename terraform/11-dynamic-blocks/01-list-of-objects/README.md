# Dynamic Blocks - List of Objects

## What is a Dynamic Block?

A dynamic block allows Terraform to create repeated nested
configuration blocks dynamically.

For example, an AWS Security Group can have multiple
ingress rules.

Without a dynamic block, we would have to write each
ingress block separately.

## Without Dynamic Block

```hcl
ingress {
  description = "SSH"
  from_port   = 22
  to_port     = 22
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}

ingress {
  description = "HTTP"
  from_port   = 80
  to_port     = 80
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}

ingress {
  description = "HTTPS"
  from_port   = 443
  to_port     = 443
  protocol    = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
