# StatefulSet in Kubernetes

## ðŸ“Œ What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?
A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes workload controller used to manage **stateful applications**. Unlike stateless apps (e.g., Nginx, API servers), stateful apps (e.g., databases, Kafka, Redis) require:
- **Stable network identity** (each pod keeps a predictable hostname).
- **Stable, persistent storage** (each pod has its own PVC that is not shared).
- **Ordered, graceful deployment, scaling, and deletion**.

Example:
- If you deploy a StatefulSet with 3 replicas named `mysql`, Kubernetes creates pods like:
  ```
  mysql-0
  mysql-1
  mysql-2
  ```
  Each pod always keeps its identity even if it restarts.

## ðŸ“Œ Why StatefulSet?
StatefulSets are useful when:
- Each pod needs **its own data** (databases, queues, message brokers).
- Pods must start in **order** (e.g., master before replicas).
- Pods need **sticky identities** (DNS names).

## ðŸ“Œ Deployment vs StatefulSet

| Feature | **Deployment** | **StatefulSet** |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Use case** | Stateless apps (e.g., web apps, APIs) | Stateful apps (e.g., MySQL, Cassandra, Kafka) |
| **Pod identity** | Pods are interchangeable | Each pod has a **sticky identity** (pod-0, pod-1â€¦) |
| **Storage** | Uses shared/ephemeral volumes | Each pod gets a **dedicated PVC** |
| **Scaling** | Pods can scale up/down randomly | Pods scale **sequentially** (ordered startup/shutdown) |
| **Networking** | Pods accessed via a Service (random backend) | Each pod gets a **stable DNS name** (`podname.service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`) |
| **Rescheduling** | New pod may come with new name/IP | Pod keeps its identity across restarts |
| **Examples** | Nginx, frontend apps, API servers | MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka, Zookeeper |

---

âœ… **In short**:
- Use **Deployment** for **stateless applications** where any pod can handle the request.
- Use **StatefulSet** for **stateful applications** where each pod needs **its own identity and storage**.
